        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
            I, <strong>Musie Tilahun</strong> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
            <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, <strong>ITIS 3135</strong>, <strong>Web App Design and Development</strong> 
            with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly 
            available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is 
            inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my 
            work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn 
            in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content 
            of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code 
            directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste 
            code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my 
            classmates.
